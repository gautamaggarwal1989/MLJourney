Standard Deviation
The standard deviation of a feature is a measure of the spread or dispersion of that feature’s values in your dataset.
s = root(sigma(xi-u)/n)
where:
xi is value for each columns
u is the mean
n is number of values in a feature

Z-Score Formula:
The z-score is calculated as:
z= (x−μ)/σ
Where:
    x = the value of the data point
    μ = the mean of the feature
    σ = the standard deviation of the feature
