'''
Multiple Linear Regression: Involves more than one independent variable (feature).
The model is represented as a hyperplane in higher dimensions.

Equation:
y=β0+β1⋅X1+β2⋅X2+⋯+βn⋅Xn+ϵ
Where:

    y is the dependent variable (target),
    X1,X2,…,Xn​ are independent variables (features),
    β0​ is the intercept,
    β1,β2,…,βn are the coefficients of each feature,
    ϵϵ is the error term.
