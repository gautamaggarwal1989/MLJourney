You’ve raised a thoughtful point about how squaring the residuals in calculating **SS\(_{\text{tot}}\)** and the **R² score** affects the interpretation of the model’s accuracy. Let’s break it down:

### Why Squaring the Differences is Used:
1. **Magnitude Emphasis**: Squaring the differences emphasizes larger deviations more than smaller ones, which helps to highlight instances where the model’s predictions are significantly off. This is important in many applications where large errors are more concerning than small ones.
  
2. **Handling Direction**: By squaring, both positive and negative differences contribute equally to the total sum of squares. Without squaring, positive and negative differences would cancel each other out, potentially understating the variability in the data.

### Potential Concerns:
1. **Loss of Directional Information**: Squaring residuals does remove the distinction between whether the model is consistently overpredicting or underpredicting. This means that the R² score does not provide information about the direction of errors, only their magnitude.

2. **Overemphasis on Outliers**: Squaring can overemphasize the impact of outliers since larger errors are disproportionately penalized. This can make the model seem worse (or better) than it actually is for most predictions, particularly if the data contains significant outliers.

### Accuracy of R² Score:
- **Context-Dependent**: The accuracy and usefulness of the R² score depend on the context in which it's used. For models where understanding the variance explained by predictors is more critical than understanding the direction of errors, R² is very useful.
  
- **Supplementary Metrics**: To address the limitations of squaring residuals, it’s common to use additional metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, which measures the average magnitude of errors without squaring them, thereby maintaining the directionality of errors. **Residual analysis** (examining the pattern of residuals) is also critical to understanding whether the model systematically overpredicts or underpredicts.

### Interpretation of R² and SS\(_{\text{tot}}\):
- **Not the Full Picture**: R² provides a measure of how well the model explains the variance in the target variable, but it does not directly address the accuracy of individual predictions or the distribution of residuals. For a complete evaluation of model performance, it is important to look at R² alongside other metrics and residual plots.

### Conclusion:
While squaring differences in SS\(_{\text{tot}}\) and using R² score provides valuable insights into the model’s explanatory power, it does not capture all aspects of model accuracy. Evaluating a model should always involve multiple metrics to ensure a comprehensive understanding of its performance, particularly the patterns and sizes of residuals.
